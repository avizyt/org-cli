Go file organizer CLI (foc)
-----

## üöÄ Organize Your Digital Life with Speed and Precision\!

**Go-FOC** is a high-performance, customizable command-line utility built with Go, designed to automatically sort and organize your files into categorized directories. Say goodbye to cluttered download folders and messy document archives ‚Äì let Go File Organizer do the heavy lifting for you\!

## ‚ú® Features

This tool is engineered for efficiency and flexibility, incorporating Go's powerful concurrency model to handle large volumes of files with ease.

1.  **Intelligent Core Sorting Logic:** Scans a specified source directory and automatically categorizes files based on their extensions (e.g., `.jpg` to `Images`, `.pdf` to `Documents`). Includes a default set of common file types and an `Others` category for unrecognized extensions.

2.  **Robust Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides intuitive flags for configuring source/destination directories, `dry-run` mode, `recursive` scanning, `workers` count, and custom `config` file paths.

3.  **Concurrent File Operations (Worker Pool):** Leverages Go's lightweight goroutines and channels to process and move multiple files simultaneously. The configurable worker pool maximizes I/O throughput, significantly reducing processing time for large datasets.

4.  **Smart Collision Resolution:** Prevents accidental overwrites by automatically detecting existing files with the same name. Duplicates are renamed by appending a timestamp (e.g., `my_photo.jpg` becomes `my_photo_20250704_153000.jpg`).

5.  **Customizable Category Mappings:** Define your own file extension-to-category mappings via a simple JSON configuration file. Custom rules override default categorizations, giving you complete control.

6.  **Beautiful & Informative CLI Experience:**

      * **Colored Output:** Clear, color-coded messages for status updates (success, errors, warnings, dry-run actions).
      * **Interactive Progress Bar:** Real-time visual feedback during file processing, indicating progress.
      * **Quiet Mode (`--quiet`):** Suppress detailed per-file output for faster, cleaner runs on large datasets, showing only the progress bar and final summary.
      * **Execution Time Tracking:** Reports the total time taken for the entire organization process in the final summary.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To get started, ensure you have Go installed (version 1.18 or higher recommended).

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/org-cli.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd org-cli
    ```

2.  **Build the executable:**

    ```bash
    go build -o organizer ./cmd/organizer
    ```

    This will create an executable named `organizer` (or `organizer.exe` on Windows) in your project root.

3.  **(Optional) Add to your PATH:** For easy access from any directory, move the `organizer` executable to a location included in your system's PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` on Linux/macOS, or a custom bin directory on Windows).

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Command Structure

```bash
./organizer --source <source_directory> --dest <destination_directory> [flags]
```

### Flags

  * `--source <path>` (required): The directory containing files to be organized.
  * `--dest <path>` (required): The root directory where organized category folders will be created.
  * `--dry-run` (optional): Simulate the process without moving or creating anything.
  * `--recursive` (optional): Scan and organize files within subdirectories.
  * `--workers <number>` (optional): Number of concurrent file operations (default: `5`). Adjust for optimal performance based on your system.
  * `--config <path>` (optional): Path to a JSON file for custom category mappings.
  * `--quiet` (optional): Suppress detailed per-file output, showing only progress and summary.

### Examples

1.  **Dry Run (Previewing Changes):**

    ```bash
    ./organizer --source ~/Downloads --dest ~/OrganizedFiles --dry-run
    ```

2.  **Organize Recursively:**

    ```bash
    ./organizer --source ~/MyMessyFolder --dest ~/CleanedUp --recursive
    ```

3.  **Organize with More Workers (e.g., for SSDs):**

    ```bash
    ./organizer --source /mnt/data/raw --dest /mnt/data/processed --workers 20
    ```

4.  **Using Custom Mappings (and quiet mode):**

    First, create a `my_mappings.json` file:

    ```json
    {
      ".log": "Application Logs",
      "svg": "Vector Graphics",
      ".md": "Markdown Notes",
      ".bak": "Backups"
    }
    ```

    Then run:

    ```bash
    ./organizer --source ~/ProjectFiles --dest ~/OrganizedProjects --config my_mappings.json --recursive --quiet
    ```

## ‚ö° Performance & Concurrency

Go File Organizer leverages Go's concurrency model with goroutines and channels to parallelize file scanning and moving, making efficient use of multi-core processors and I/O bandwidth. The configurable worker pool ensures optimal throughput. For large file sets, increasing the `--workers` count and using the `--quiet` flag are highly recommended to maximize speed.

-----

## üõ°Ô∏è Collision Resolution

To prevent data loss, if a file with the same name already exists in the target category folder, the new file will be automatically renamed by appending a timestamp before its extension (e.g., `report.pdf` becomes `report_20250704_220740.pdf`).
